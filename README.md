# Christmas AIV's exercises

## define C DataStructures
- [x] DynamicArray
- [ ] LinkedList
- [ ] DoubleLinkedList

### DynamicArray
Dynarray was modified the lesson's code with less realloc syscall.
Use the clove.h for tests, updated the project structure, insert bat configurations
and implements the remove symbol.

### LinkedList
Implemented the remove symbol, use the preprocessor directive to do some casts,
use the clove.h for tests, insert bat configurations.
NOTE: there is a little bug on the remove methods but it's too late to resolve it now.
